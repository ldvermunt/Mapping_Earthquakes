# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository was to learn how to use Javascript and API's to create maps.  In this project we used Leaflet and Mapbox to call API's from the USGS and make a map of worldwide earthquake data.
## Outcome
The finished product is an interactive world map that displays the last seven days of worldwide earthquake activity.  A user is able to toggle on and off the mapped quakes as well as the planets tectonic plates.  In additon three map layers (Courtesy Mapbox) are also user selectable.  The data is further interactive via popups which display the earthquake strength and location.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111530580/204111524-9006bc16-b4da-480c-aceb-e198b39e3721.png)
